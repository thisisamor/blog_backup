## About this repo

"i didnt know how to do a proper backup so here we are, made a new repo to keep my code ...at least it would do the job, i guess."

For more information about backing up, see [here](https://thisisamor.github.io/2023/04/14/000-Test-Wrap-Up/#Backup).

## Warning

DO NOT open commits "new post: Test Wrap Up", "remove ignored files" or "what happened" which were made on April 16th. 

These were created when I accidentally committed everything (including the log files), then deleted everything, then recommited. The file lists for these three commits are forever long. 

(Duck when can i manage to use git...)

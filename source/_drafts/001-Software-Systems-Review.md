<small style="opacity: 0.7;">My conversation with GPT (about Hexo) eventually turned to database and network systems. So, I wrote this post to review my Software Systems course.  </small>

## Intro

Almost any modern **software system** comprises of: 
- **Databases**: Where data is stored.
- **Networks**: How data move around between different computers. 
- **Applications**: How applications access and utilize networks and databases to implement their functionalities. 

An **Internet exchange point** (IXP) is a physical location through which internet infrastructure companies such as **Internet Service Providers** (ISPs) and **Content distribution networks** (CDNs) connect with each other.

<small style="opacity: 0.7;">This <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-book"></i> [Notion site](https://amor-zhao.notion.site/Information-1dd18481598a4787b7b82b10261ea6f6) shows my logbook for the Information Processing Lab. It was not assessed, so I just used it to keep track of what I've done. Specifically, lab 5 and 6 required to use the knowledge and techniques covered in this course. </small>

<small style="opacity: 0.7;">It would be better to have pictures in a blog. That's what this test post is for. </small>

#### Pinterest URL

Started by using URLs of three random posts from my Pinterest acc. 

It worked. 

But considering the possible ristrictions to Pinterest in China, I deleted them. I hate the icon being displayed when images fail to load.

#### GitHub URL

Same way, but using an image in my github repo. 

![test4](https://github.com/thisisamor/blog_pic/blob/main/avatar.jpg?raw=true)

Using HTML to set picture size and add a caption: 

<figure>
  <img src="https://github.com/thisisamor/blog_pic/blob/main/avatar.jpg?raw=true" width="200" alt="cat">
  <figcaption>This is a cat. </figcaption>
</figure>


So I guess I'll just use this repo as an album: upload everything there, copy-paste the link of my picture. As long as my repo is there (and public ofc) I should be fine.

#### Other methods

To make it clear, there _are_ other ways of embedding pictures into a website, as suggested on CSDN. 

- PicGo: Set up github repo, generate token and do the identification, then you should be able to upload pictures to your album. (It never successfully uploaded for me tho, no error message, nothing.)
- Gitee: They do not support uk phone numbers. I didn't get very far with this either.

#### “图床”

昨晚碰巧看到有人说[路过图床](https://imgse.com)，听说比较稳定。

思考了一下 PicGo 是用来干什么的，是用来往自己的 repo 里上传图片的吗??? 那我要是可以从网页版直接传图片，是不是就用不到了？

所以，公开的 Pinterest，公开的 Instagram，公开的 repo，理论上讲都不是不能用。

“Overall, hosting images in a repository and loading them using their URLs can be a cost-effective and convenient solution for small projects or personal websites. However, for larger-scale applications, it may be worth considering a dedicated image hosting service that is optimized for performance and scalability."

我的小树洞博客，害，就这样吧。

#### 关于中文字体

在手机上访问这个博客页面时，使用不同的浏览器，中文字体不一定成功地显示。

我也不知道问题可能出在哪里，可能是因为 NexT 只支持若干种浏览器？

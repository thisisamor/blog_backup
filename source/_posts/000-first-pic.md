<small style="opacity: 0.7;">It would be better to have pictures in a blog. That's what this test post is for. </small>

#### Pinterest URL

If I simply load the pictures with their url...

Lets see. Here are three random posts from my Pinterest acc: 

![test](https://i.pinimg.com/750x/57/09/8b/57098bd4348a39fa60185ad5ff0b160a.jpg)

![test2](https://i.pinimg.com/750x/e8/8a/02/e88a0246ddf512de1a7bebe65b80fe83.jpg)

![test3](https://i.pinimg.com/750x/ff/8e/b4/ff8eb4a9179639afc53fc3ac148d7f9d.jpg)

It works! (they may not load in china tho)

#### GitHub URL

Same way, but using image in github repo. 

![test4](https://github.com/thisisamor/blog_pic/blob/main/avatar.jpg?raw=true)

So I guess I'll just use this repo as an album: upload everything there, copy-paste the link of my picture. As long as my repo is there (and public ofc) I should be fine.

#### Other methods

To make it clear, there _are_ other ways of embedding pictures into a website, as suggested on CSDN. 

- PicGo: Set up github repo, generate token and do the identification, then you should be able to upload pictures to your album. (It never successfully uploaded for me tho, no error message, nothing.)
- Gitee: They do not support uk phone numbers. I didn't get very far with this either.

#### 关于中文字体

在手机上访问这个博客页面时，使用不同的浏览器，中文字体不一定成功地显示。

比如，在我的手机上，via 和微信里直接打开的时候，dark mode 和字体都是正确的，但是用夸克浏览器或者手机默认浏览器就成了黑体。

我也不知道问题可能出在哪里。
